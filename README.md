# Simple SmartThings Automation App

This simple SmartThings automation app turns lights on when a contact sensor opens
and off again when it closes. It's built using the [SmartThings SmartApp NodeJS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartthings/smartapp).

For more information about building automations and device integrations on the
SmartThings platform see the [SmartThings Developer Portal](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/).
