# Simple SmartThings Automation App

This simple SmartThings automation app turns lights on when a multipurpose sensor opens,
and off again when it closes. This automation handles CONFIRMATION requests from the SmartThings API. It was built using the [SmartThings SmartApp NodeJS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartthings/smartapp).

For more information about building automations and device integrations on the
SmartThings platform see the [SmartThings Developer Portal](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/).
